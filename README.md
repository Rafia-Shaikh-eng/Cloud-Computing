## Project#01: Video Streaming using Kafka
### Description of Project
Video streaming using Apache Kafka and OpenCV libraries. The motivation behind the project is the need for effective management and analysis of large-scale video streams generated from sources such as surveillance cameras. Kafka is a distributed message streaming platform that is resilient to node failure and supports automatic recovery. OpenCV is an open-source image processing library designed for real-time applications, including the processing and analysis of images and videos. The project uses Kafka for real-time data acquisition, OpenCV for video rendering, and Flask for the distributed consumer. The video client generates data as a producer, which streams video directly from a webcam in real-time and converts it into a stream of JPEG images.
